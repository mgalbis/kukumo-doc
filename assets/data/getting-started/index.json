Since there is no theming system for Gridsome yet, Jamdocs comes with Gridsome, plug-ins and packages as dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Local installation\r\n\r\nEven though Jamdocs is so simple, you dont really need to set it up localy (you could just fork it on github to edit styles and md-files) - if you want to change it up a bit I recommend setting up localy for a better developer experience.\r\n\r\nTo set up a new instance of Jamdocs, and start developing just clone the project from Github like, go to the directory and run gridsome:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/samuelhorn/jamdocs project-name\r\ncd project-name\r\ngridsome develop\r\n```\r\n"}},"context":{}}
